# toxic-commentary
Repository for a Toxic Comment identification [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge).

After the contest closed, I chose to take the datasets and apply them to a web-app for toxic comment detection. 
I plan to use the webapp as a demo to show off, and I'll link to it here in due time.

So far I have explored different models, then I'll drop in the model later.
