## A few notes for the readers:

I placed the embedding vectors and the dataset from kaggle under `.gitignore` so I didn't push a gigabyte of stuff onto my remote. 

If you want to clone this and copy my work, you'll need to download the [kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data) and the [GloVe Embeddings](http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip) and save them in this directory under thier default filenames (`train.csv`, `test.csv`, `sample_submission.csv`, and `glove.6B` and all it's contents).
